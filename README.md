### Hi there and welcome to my Git account. 👋🌻

I am a Data Engineering and Artificial Intelligence Engineer, with strong interest in data analytics, machine learning, data pipelines, and AI-driven solutions. I have completed all my university coursework and my graduation is scheduled for May 23.

This GitHub repository serves as my technical portfolio, where I share projects developed throughout my academic, research, and applied experience, focused on transforming data into actionable insights and real-world solutions.

My enthusiasm for research has led me to be part of research groups where I have had the opportunity to
research seedlings, where I have had the opportunity to develop projects with social
projects with social impact and to acquire advanced technical skills.
